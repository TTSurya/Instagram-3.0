    <div class="accordion-header">a. Hashing</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
It is the process of applying a hash function to the input data in order to produce a fixed-size hash value.<br>
h(data) = hashVal
<br><br>
Detailed explanation:
<ul>
    <li>It is an <em>irreversible</em> (not exactly) process of transforming data to fixed-size hash values for the verification of data integrity, indexing, and quick data retrieval.</li>
it is the process of applying a hash function to the input data in order to produce a fixed-size hash value    <li>Alternatively,  (regardless of the size of the input data).</li>
    <li>A hash function is a function that converts the input and generates a unique hash value of fixed length as output.</li>
    <li>It is not exactly irreversible, but rather computationally infeasible to reverse engineer it.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Properties of a <em>good hash function</em> include
<ul>
    <li><code>Collision resistance</code> (minimizing the likelihood of different inputs having the same hash value)</li>
    <li><code>Avalanche effect</code> (a.k.a anti-clustering, small change in input data results in significant change in output hash value, so that the reverse engineers can't derive any meaningful information regarding the hash)</li>
    <li><code>Deterministic</code> (hash function is a <em>function</em> in the mathematical sense)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">b. Target Hash</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
<ul>
    <li>In <code>PoW</code> blockchains, each block has a unique identifier known as the <code>block hash</code>. This hash is calculated by taking the data in the block (including transactions, timestamp etc.) and running it through a cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA-256).</li>
    <li>Miners must find a <code>random number</code> and combine it with the block data in such a way that the resulting block hash must be less than or equal to some <code>threshold value</code>.</li>
    <li>The random number is called the <code>Nonce</code> and the threshold value is called the <code>Target Hash</code>.</li>
    <li>Finding a nonce that produces the <code>Target Hash</code> is the <em>proof of work</em>. It requires significant computational effort and energy. The first miner to find a valid <code>Nonce</code> gets to create the next block in the blockchain and is rewarded for their work.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">c. <code>NFT</code></div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
<ul>
    <li>A non-fungible token (<code>NFT</code>) is a unique digital identifier that is recorded on a blockchain and is used to certify ownership and authenticity of digital assets such as digital art, music, audio, videos, etc.</li>
    <li>Artists and creators can tokenize their work as <code>NFT</code>s, enabling them to monetize digital content and retain ownership rights.</li>
    <li>They are non-fungible because unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, where each token is interchangeable and of equal value, <code>NFT</code>s are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.</li>
    <li><code>NFT</code>s allow individuals to buy, sell, and trade ownership of digital assets in a decentralized manner.</li>
    <li>There are online marketplaces dedicated to buying, selling, and trading <code>NFT</code>s (e.g. NBA Top Shot).</li>
</ul>

    <div class="accordion-header">d. Consensus Protocol</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
<ul>
    <li>In the context of communication systems, a <code>Protocol</code> is a set of rules and guidelines that govern how data is transmitted, received, and processed, which helps devices to effectively exchange information and interact with one another.</li>
    <li>In a similar fashion, the <code>consensus protocol</code> is a set of rules and procedures that enable the nodes in a network to agree on the state of a shared ledger.</li>
    <li>They primarily maintain the integrity of the blockchain technology and ensure its security implicitly in the protocol; In other words, different consensus protocols can lead to varying degrees of decentralization which impacts the security of the network.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Commonly Used Consensus Protocols:
<br>
<ul>
    <li><code>PoW</code> - Proof of Work involves <code>miners</code> competing to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add a new block to the blockchain.</li>
    <li><code>PoS</code> - In Proof of Stake system, the <code>validators</code> are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of <code>cryptocurrency</code> they are willing to <code>stake as collateral</code>. This encourages the validators to follow the protocol to protect their staked assets.</li>
</ul>
