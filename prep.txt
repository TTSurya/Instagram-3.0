A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger that records transactions in a series of blocks. These blocks are 
linked together in a chronological order, forming a chain of blocks (hence the name "blockchain"). Each block 
contains a set of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, creating an immutable record 
of all transactions.
